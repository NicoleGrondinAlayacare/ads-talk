MAIN IDEA: What's a design system for us and how we build it... and why?

## What problems are we trying to solve?

    Copying and pasting code in components is messy, error prone, `bug emoji`

## What's a design system... for us? 
    Tons of resources out there...
    No clear definition

## How do we do it?
    1 - Design approach

        An interesting thing are the repeating patterns.  It helps product to think about what they want, and not only focus in the UI.
    Helps them to focus on what problems are we solving for the user, in a way tha  it's efficient for them, and specially esay to use.

    It's like giving LEGOS to a product person that need to solve a real world problem.

    They put down in paper, how every piece should be used, what problem is solving each "LEGO brick" and how they can be put together to addrees bigger problems, in a way that is consistent.

    We can show the specs of a component created the design/product team? ----  maybe it's more of a how we do it part


    2 - Technical approach

        versioning
        predictable release notes
        using an npm lib tackles the coy-and-paste strategy when sharing/creating component?.... Give more structure ot it.
        The npm  lib takes away the surprise factor... you can pin to specific versions when working with external parties, between teams, etc.

    
    Talk about the tooling and the resulting artifacts. - What tools do we use... how do we use them together to solve the needs expressed before?

        Go over the creation of a component... Show the tools used in each step, from design to actual publishing and integration in the main app.

        To use a FUNNY example component. It does not need to be real, it only needs to be funny.


    
     ? 3 -Product and Leadership approach ?



---------

Don't loose the focus on the goal of using the design system somewhere else. In tthis case it's within the main app, but it can be other places (external contractor code).
    The `app/ads` route is something we should talk about...

    And maybe how to integrate/migrate the current component (We are still figuring out this part).

    We think that the workflow and the tooling in place, give us a better chance of handling the complexity and minimizing the agonizing pain.

    Talk about why it feels like a lot work:
        - BEcause it is
        - Because it's worth it....
